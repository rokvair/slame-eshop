 * authenticating version. The authenticating version automatically adds the header to pass
 * JWT to the server.
 * 
 * When user logs out via StatusAndLogOut, the backend is replaced by non-authenticating version.
 *
 * The App component check if JWT is present on initialization. If so, it switches to authenticating
 * backend connector. This allows non-root route URLs to work as long as proper JWT is present in session
 * state.
